# PythonProject2

There are two source files as described below:

• The first file named clockApp.py, should contain the following two classes:

  • The first is a class called Clock which defines a simple object type representing a clock
    with one alarm time.
  • The second class called clockList defines objects which are containers of clock
    objects.
    
• The second file named clockDriver.py defines a Python application, with main method,
  which creates one clockList object and allows the various methods of clock to be
  called. This class will be an interactive application using the keyboard and the screen to
  interact with a human operator. It will not do calculations itself but will immediately pass
  user inputs as arguments to methods of clockList class.
